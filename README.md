Old age and lack of attention to health is an everyday story. 

Buddie4healtH tracks, records, stores and notifies regular Biometric data generating your EMR (Heart rate, Blood Pressure, Body Temperature, SPO2 levels). This data is continuously monitored, and gives alerts to the doctor when the health vitals are tripping to danger levels and it's also a good idea of long term health issues of the patient which helps to predict future anomalies by comparing this data with the available health records and send a message in case of abnormality.
